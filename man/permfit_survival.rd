\usage{
permfit_survival(
  train,
  validate = NULL,
  k_fold = 5,
  n_perm = 100,
  pathway_list = list(),
  method = c("ensemble_dnnet", "random_forest", "lasso", "linear", "svm", "dnnet",
    "survival_cox", "survival_aft", "DeepSurv", "DeepHit", "Xgboost", "Survival_SVM",
    "DnnSurv")[8],
  shuffle = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{A training dataset, which is a dnnetSurvInput object created by deepTL::importDnnetSurv().}

\item{validate}{A validation dataset is required when k_fold = 0.}

\item{k_fold}{K-fold cross-fitting. Default is k_fold = 5. If preferring not to use the cross-fitting strategy, set k_fold to zero.}

\item{n_perm}{Number of permutations repeated for each feature, which is R in the manuscript's algorithm 1. Default is n_perm = 100.}

\item{pathway_list}{For categorical variables, dummy variables should be created in advance. For variables with more than 2 categories, all the corresponding dummy variables should be included in the pathway_list and permuted simultaneously to calculate the permutation feature importance.}

\item{method}{Name of the method:
- "random_forest" for Random Survival Forest;
- "survival_aft" for Accelerated Failure Time Model;
- "survival_cox" for Cox-PH Model;
- "DeepSurv" for DeepSurv;
- "DeepHit" for DeepHit;
- "Xgboost" for XGBoost;
- "Survival_SVM" for Survival Support Vector Machine;
- "lasso" for Lasso-Cox;
- "ensemble_dnnet" for SurvDNN.}

\item{shuffle}{If NULL, the data will be shuffled for cross-fitting; if random shuffle is not desired, provide a vector of numbers for cross-fitting indices.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to each method.}
}
\value{
A PermFIT object, with importance = permutation feature importance for all continuous and binary features, and imp_block = permutation feature importance for all categorical features with more than two groups.
