\usage{
log_lik_diff(
  model.type,
  y_hat,
  y_hat0,
  object,
  y_max = 1 - 10^-10,
  y_min = 10^-10,
  y_hatcoxl,
  y_hat0coxl
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model.type}{Default is "survival" for survival data.}

\item{y_hat}{A numeric vector of patients' survival risk predictions.}

\item{y_hat0}{A numeric vector of patients' survival risk predictions based on permuted data (details explained in the manuscript).}

\item{object}{Validation dataset, a dnnetSurvInput object created by deepTL::importDnnetSurv().}

\item{y_max}{Inner upper boundary for y in binary classification; can be ignored when model.type is "survival".}

\item{y_min}{Inner lower boundary for y in binary classification; can be ignored when model.type is "survival".}

\item{y_hatcoxl}{A numeric vector of patients' survival risk predictions returned by Cox-related models, e.g., Cox, SurvDNN, XGBoost.}

\item{y_hat0coxl}{A numeric vector of patients' survival risk predictions returned by Cox-related models based on permuted data.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector consisting of differences in C-index, Cox's partial log-likelihood, and average time-dependent AUC, based on observed and permuted data.
